# Structural Design Patterns

Structural patterns explain how to assemble objects and classes into larger structures while keeping these structures flexible and efficient.

## Patterns in this Category

### [Adapter](./adapter-pattern.md)
Allows incompatible interfaces to work together by wrapping an object with an adapter.

### [Bridge](./bridge-pattern.md)
Separates abstraction from implementation so they can vary independently.

### [Composite](./composite-pattern.md)
Composes objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies.

### [Decorator](./decorator-pattern.md)
Adds new functionality to objects dynamically without altering their structure.

### [Facade](./facade-pattern.md)
Provides a simplified interface to a complex subsystem.

### [Flyweight](./flyweight-pattern.md)
Reduces memory usage by sharing common state among multiple objects.

### [Proxy](./proxy-pattern.md)
Provides a surrogate or placeholder to control access to an object.

## When to Use Structural Patterns

- When you need to simplify complex relationships between objects
- When you want to add functionality without modifying existing code
- When you need to optimize memory usage
- When you want to control access to objects
