# Behavioral Design Patterns

Behavioral patterns are concerned with algorithms and the assignment of responsibilities between objects.

## Patterns in this Category

### [Chain of Responsibility](./chain-of-responsibility.md)
Passes requests along a chain of handlers, where each handler decides to process or pass it.

### [Command](./command-pattern.md)
Encapsulates a request as an object, allowing parameterization and queuing of requests.

### [Iterator](./iterator-pattern.md)
Provides a way to access elements of a collection sequentially without exposing underlying representation.

### [Mediator](./mediator-pattern.md)
Reduces coupling by making objects communicate through a mediator rather than directly.

### [Observer](./observer-pattern.md)
Defines a subscription mechanism to notify multiple objects about events.

### [State](./state-pattern.md)
Allows an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes.

### [Strategy](./strategy-pattern.md)
Defines a family of algorithms and makes them interchangeable.

### [Template Method](./template-method-pattern.md)
Defines the skeleton of an algorithm, letting subclasses override specific steps.

### [Visitor](./visitor-pattern.md)
Separates algorithms from the objects they operate on.

## When to Use Behavioral Patterns

- When you need flexible communication between objects
- When you want to define algorithms independently
- When object behavior depends on state
- When you need to decouple sender and receiver
