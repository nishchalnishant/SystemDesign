# Creational Design Patterns

Creational patterns provide various object creation mechanisms, which increase flexibility and reuse of existing code.

## Patterns in this Category

### [Abstract Factory](./abstract-factory-pattern.md)
Provides an interface for creating families of related objects without specifying concrete classes.

### [Builder](./builder-pattern.md)
Constructs complex objects step by step, allowing different representations using the same construction process.

### [Factory Method](./factory-pattern.md)
Defines an interface for creating objects but lets subclasses decide which class to instantiate.

### [Prototype](./prototype-pattern.md)
Creates new objects by cloning existing objects, avoiding expensive initialization.

### [Singleton](./singleton.md)
Ensures a class has only one instance and provides global access to it.

## When to Use Creational Patterns

- When object creation is complex or resource-intensive
- When you need to decouple object creation from usage
- When you want to control object instantiation
- When you need families of related objects
