## Preparation Strategy

1. **Tier 1 (Fire )**: Implement these **from scratch** 3 times. These are your bread and butter. 
 * *Parking Lot, Rate Limiter, Vending Machine, Tic-Tac-Toe, Splitwise*.
2. **Tier 2 (Green )**: Understand the **Class Diagram** and **Key Design Pattern**.
 * *Elevator, Snake & Ladder, Comments, Hotel, LRU Cache*.
3. **Tier 3 (Yellow )**: Read the code to understand **specific algorithms** (e.g. QuadTree for Locker, Tries for Search).
