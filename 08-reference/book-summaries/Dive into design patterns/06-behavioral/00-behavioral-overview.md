# Behavioral Design Patterns — Overview

> Behavioral patterns are concerned with **algorithms** and the **assignment of responsibilities between objects**.

## The Eleven Behavioral Patterns

### ▸ Chain of Responsibility
Lets you pass requests along a chain of handlers. Upon receiving a request, each handler decides either to process the request or to pass it to the next handler in the chain.

### ▸ Command
Turns a request into a stand-alone object that contains all information about the request. This transformation lets you pass requests as a method arguments, delay or queue a request's execution, and support undoable operations.

### ▸ Iterator
Lets you traverse elements of a collection without exposing its underlying representation (list, stack, tree, etc.).

### ▸ Mediator
Lets you reduce chaotic dependencies between objects. The pattern restricts direct communications between the objects and forces them to collaborate only via a mediator object.

### ▸ Memento
Lets you save and restore the previous state of an object without revealing the details of its implementation.

### ▸ Observer
Lets you define a subscription mechanism to notify multiple objects about any events that happen to the object they're observing.

### ▸ State
Lets an object alter its behavior when its internal state changes. It appears as if the object changed its class.

### ▸ Strategy
Lets you define a family of algorithms, put each of them into a separate class, and make their objects interchangeable.

### ▸ Template Method
Defines the skeleton of an algorithm in the superclass but lets subclasses override specific steps of the algorithm without changing its structure.

### ▸ Visitor
Lets you separate algorithms from the objects on which they operate.
