# ML system design

* Take 5 minute or so to understand the question&#x20;
* make assumption by limiting the amount of questions to be asked. just assume any generic numbers
* save time be deliberate with high level system desing digram. instead of xgboost use model and decide which model to use later.
* data consideration -- there are lot of data considration \[8-9 min]
  * what are your labels
  * what are your features
  * how to represent data
  * how to split the data
  * how to deal with imbalances&#x20;
* most impo thing -- talk about
  * modelling&#x20;
  * metrics
  * training
  * overfitting and other issues&#x20;
  * cold start
  * time travel problem
* at its code its all about either classification or regression&#x20;
* last final&#x20;
  * come up with multiple solution and answer which solution is better and discuss the tradeoffs
