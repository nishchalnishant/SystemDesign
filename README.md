# System design (HLD+LLD)

* There are two kinds of designs included while designing any system
  * High-Level Design (HLD)
  * Low-Level Design (LLD)
* Lets describe them in details
  * **High-Level Design:**
    * It includes top-level design of our entire application Like how much scalability, cost, request application can handle at a time.
      * This work is mostly done by the Principle Engineers or Product Managers
      * But in interviews, it is expected that at least the candidate should have a basic idea about these terminologies.
      *   Like what are Load balancers, Caching, Compute Power, SQL vs NoSQL, Streaming, Data Modeling, etc. Few important topics are like

          * Design Twitter
          * Design Prime Music
          * Design Google Drive
          * Design Uber
          * Design Netflix
          * Design Instagram


* **Low-Level Design:**
  * Low-Level Design is <mark style="color:blue;">also known as machine coding</mark> round in interviews it includes questions like design a basic crud operation of any system and then writes code for that with test cases and deployment.
  * In this round interviewer want to check your DSA knowledge as well as OOPs knowledge.
  * Suppose in the given problem like(Create a note taking app) interviewer will ask questions like how you will organize data, how to fetch data, which data structure to use and why, test cases, UML, ER Diagram, etc.
  * In organizations when any project comes then HLD is done by the PMs but the low-level design is done by the SDE-1, SDE-2. It is like breaking a big problem into smaller units and then solving it.
  * So while preparing for an interview or going for a job System Design is always very important in both places. And this comes with the practice of the questions asked in different interviews.
