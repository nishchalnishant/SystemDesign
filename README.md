## Key Principles for SDE-3 Interviews

### 1. Always Discuss Trade-offs

Don't just say "I'd use Redis for caching." Say:
> "I'd use Redis for caching because:
> - Sub-millisecond latency (critical for our 100ms SLA)
> - Rich data structures (sorted sets for leaderboards)
> - Limited storage (use LRU eviction)
> - Not durable (persist to DB as source of truth)"

### 2. Think at Scale

- Start simple, then scale
- "For 1K users, single server works. At 1M users, we need..."
- Use real numbers (capacity estimation)

### 3. Production Mindset

- Monitoring: "How do we know it's working?"
- Failure scenarios: "What if the DB goes down?"
- Operational complexity: "How hard is this to maintain?"

### 4. Communication

- Think out loud
- Draw diagrams
- Ask clarifying questions
- Validate assumptions with interviewer

## Migration from Old Structure

If you're familiar with the old repository structure:

| Old Location | New Location |
|--------------|--------------|
| `system-design-hld+lld/hld/basics.md` | `1. Core Concepts/fundamentals.md` |
| `glossary.md` + `system-design-components.md` | `1. Core Concepts/databases.md` |
| `30-days-theory/` | **Removed** (content integrated into Core Concepts) |
| `hld/notes/interview-process/` | `3. HLD Interview Problems/` |
| `lld/lld-interview-guide.md` | `5. Interview Templates/lld-template.md` |

**What was removed:**
- Duplicate content (glossary, repeated design patterns)
- 30-days-theory (integrated into core concepts)
- Scattered interview questions (now organized by difficulty)

**What was added:**
- Advanced distributed systems topics
- Interview templates with timing
- Capacity estimation formulas
- Trade-off decision matrices
- Enhanced problem descriptions with capacity estimation
